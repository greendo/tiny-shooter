TODO:

1. Backend and front proper disconnect behavior;
2. Render frontend optimisation (caching static background and platforms perhaps?);
3. Fixing links and their logic in cabinet;
4. Proper backend world creation;
5. Frontend world initialisation via eval seems bad idea;
6. Scheduler updates all rooms one by one, all rooms must be updated in different threads;
7. Bullets and weapons both front and back;
